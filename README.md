# Rock, Paper, Scissors

A simple Python program that simulates the classic rock, paper, scissors game.

## How it works

    1. The program prompts the user to enter "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
    2. The users input is then compared to the computers randomly generated choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
    3. After comparing choices, a winner is determined and the player who won will receive a point for the round, unless it is a tie then no points are awarded.
    4. Once the user or the computer reaches 3 wins, the game ends, a winner is declared, and the user is then asked if they want to play again.

## How to run

    1. Clone the repository.
    2. run the script using Python:
        ```bash
        python rock-paper-scissors.py```
